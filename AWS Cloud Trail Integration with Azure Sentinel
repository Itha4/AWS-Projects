# Integrating AWS logs to Azure Sentinel

 Hybrid clouds are fast becoming the new norm, organizations are now running their workloads across different clouds and having a one stop security management for all clouds would definitely be a good thing.
 Azure Sentinel offers visibility into the other clouds by allowing for intgeration with the clouds through different mechanisms. 
 I will be focusing on how to connect your Cloud Trail Logs to Azure Sentinel. Follow through and learn something.

Microsoft Sentinel is Azure’s SIEM, Security Incidents and Events Monitoring and SOAR, Security Orchestration and Automated Response tool. Sentinel is designed to provide a single solution for alert detection, threat visibility, proactive hunting and threat response.
Sentinel’s work is based on data collected from various resources. Sentinel offers integrations with other parties;
-	Integration with private infrastructure: by deploying Syslog servers as data collectors or by configuring endpoints to send data to azure directly
-	Integration with GPS: using REST SPIs, log collectors or by deploying a CASB, Cloud Access Security Broker.
-	Integration with AWS: using Cloud Trail which provides insights into user and network activity, the cloud trail logs can be integrated with Azure Sentinel.

AWS Cloud Trail is a web service that records API calls to supported AWS services in your AWS account an delivers a log file to your s3 bucket.
Benefits of Cloud Trail include;
-	There’s controlled access to log files: access to S3 log files is centrally controlled in AWS which allows for controlled access of the log files and helps maintain their integrity.
-	You can easily obtain alerts on Log File Creation and Misconfiguration
-	Cloud Trail allows you to manage changes to AWS resources and log files.
-	Offers an option to store logs for longer, logs can be stored for a year or longer or as per the organization’s chosen retention period.
-	Logs collected in Cloud Trail can be used to generate customized reports
